## 3D Lane Line Detection with Thresholding and ROI Techniques - LiDAR Point Cloud

The Lane Line Detection pipeline is based on Threshold and Region of Interest (ROI) techniques to detect lane lines.

1. The Threshold Technique: By implementing the Threshold Technique, extracted the most relevant lane line points from the LiDAR Point Cloud data.

2. The Region of Interest (ROI) Technique: To enhance the Lane Line Detection pipeline's performance, Region of Interest Technique is applied on output obtained from Threshold technique.
