## 3D Lane Line Detection with LiDAR Point Cloud

The Lane Line Detection pipeline is based on Threshold and Region of Interest (ROI) techniques to detect lane lines.
The Threshold Technique: At the core of our solution lies intelligent data processing. By implementing the Threshold Technique, extracted the most relevant lane line points from the LiDAR Point Cloud data.
The Region of Interest (ROI) Technique: To enhance the Lane Line Detection pipeline's performance, Region of Interest Technique is applied on output obtained from Threshold technique.
